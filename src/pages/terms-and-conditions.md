Customers of Floriade Ltd. ordering flowers or plants online from floriade.co.nz or by other means such as over the phone, via email or txt agree to the following terms and conditions:

## flowers

Floriade Ltd. creates beautiful, bespoke floral bouquets and arrangements for each individual customer. We are proud to supply the freshest possible flowers to all of our clients.

All images on our website are examples of our work. Throughout the year, specific flowers and colours of flowers are subject to seasonal availability. Not all flowers and plants shown are available all year round. While we will make every attempt to fulfil your order as requested, we reserve the right to substitute flowers with other varieties of equivalent quality, colour and value if your first choice is not available.

## delivery

Floriade Ltd. can deliver flowers to Wellington city and suburbs, Porirua city and the Hutt valley. We cannot deliver outside of Wellington, New Zealand.

Floriade Ltd. offers a same-day delivery service Monday to Saturday. If you order flowers before midday, Monday to Friday on the day you want them delivered, Floriade Ltd. will endeavour to deliver your flowers the same day. Orders placed after midday will usually be delivered the following morning.

Flowers that are to be delivered to business addresses will usually be delivered within business hours, (9am - 5pm). Flowers going to private home addresses may be delivered up until 7pm.

If you order flowers for same-day delivery on a Saturday, your order must be in before 10am on the Saturday you want them delivered. Any order placed after this time will be delivered on the following Monday.

Deliveries are not available on Sundays or Public holidays.

Specific times for delivery cannot be guaranteed, however we do attempt to get flowers delivered within a reasonable timeframe. If same-day delivery is not possible due to circumstances beyond our control, we will keep you informed and attempt to deliver the order as soon as possible.

Whilst Floriade Ltd. does offer same-day delivery of flowers to the Wellington region, there are some situations or exceptions where this may not be possible. These may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:

* Floriade Ltd. has been provided with an incorrect delivery address or name of recipient.
* There is nobody at the address and/or the courier believes that there is a risk of theft or damage to the flowers.
For example, bad weather may damage the flowers, if there is no shade to leave the flowers in or if the flowers are visible from the street.
* The recipient’s contact number is incorrect and they cannot be contacted for delivery.
* Circumstances beyond our control such as emergency, auto failure, auto accident, fire, natural disaster, personal injury etc

It is the responsibility of the person placing the order to ensure that the name and address of the recipient provided is correct. If the order is delivered to the wrong person or address because of incorrect information supplied, it is not the responsibility of Floriade Ltd. to provide a refund or to deliver the item again.

Additional charges will apply for re-direction of an order or if a new arrangement has to be made and redelivered.

Please be aware that these delivery times may vary during extra busy times of the year such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, or Christmas, or if your order is to be delivered to an area outside of our regular delivery area.

Once the flowers/plants have been delivered, it is then the responsibility of the recipient to care for their products.

## pricing

All items on our website are priced in New Zealand dollars including GST (Goods and Services Tax) of 15%. There are additional fees chargeable at the checkout to cover delivery costs which vary according to the delivery location. Orders may be picked up from our workshop for free.

If ordering from outside New Zealand, please check the exchange rate in your local currency at time of purchase for an up to date pricing (For example web sites such as xe.com give up to date exchange rates.).

## payment

Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard or American Express on our website. Payment is required in full before deliveries are made.

## satisfaction guarantee

Floriade Ltd. is proud to supply the freshest possible flowers to our customers. However, sometimes the life of your flowers can be shortened for reasons beyond our control. These include things like grower production, extremely high weather temperatures, transportation issues and so on. Therefore, if your flowers wilt within 24 hours of delivery, and you’ve looked after them according to the care instructions given, please contact us and we will investigate the situation for you immediately. If it is deemed that the flowers did not last as long as reasonably expected then we will arrange for the situation to be rectified as soon as possible with our sincere apologies and compliments. This may be through a replacement product or a gift voucher. However, this is at the discretion of Floriade Ltd.

Please note that flowers are a perishable item and vary according to floral variety as to how long they will last.

We are not obliged to exchange or refund any items in the event you have changed your mind.

## order cancellations, refunds & changes to orders

If you need to change details of an order please contact us within a reasonable time frame to allow us to make the changes as required.

If you wish to cancel your order once it has been placed but prior to it being delivered or picked up, we are happy to offer a full refund given 24 hours’ notice.

We are unable to offer a refund if the order has already been delivered, picked up or is in transit to the delivery location.

If an order is cancelled, an administration fee of $10.00 will be taken off the full value refunded to cover the bank refund fees and time to cancel the order.

## time frame for complaints

All complaints, questions or concerns regarding your flower order must be received within 24 hours of the flowers being delivered so that the matter can be addressed immediately.

## privacy and security
