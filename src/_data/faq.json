    "question": "How do I keep my flowers fresh?",
    "answer": "Clean water is the most important thing for keeping flowers fresh for a long time. Swap out the water every 2-3 days for maximum longevity. Additionally, all fresh arrangements come with a sachet of flower preserver taped inside the wrapping paper. Use about a third of the packet initially and another third or so with every water change. It’s also best to keep the flowers in a cool spot out of the sun. With proper care, and depending on the varieties included, your arrangement should last anywhere between 1 and 3 weeks."

    "question": "How long do dried flowers last?",
    "answer": "Dried flowers can stay looking amazing for more than a year. To keep them in pristine condition, display them in a dry place. Avoid damp rooms like a bathroom as this can cause the flowers to wilt and develop mould. It’s also important to keep the flowers out of the sun as it can make the colours fade. Give your arrangement a gentle dust every once in a while to keep it looking clean and vibrant."
